#PHP7 Programming Cookbook

This is the code repository for the book [PHP 7 Programming Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/php-7-programming-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785883446). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

##Instuctions and Navigations

All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
<?php
protected static function loadFile($file)
    {
        if (file_exists($file)) {
            require_once $file;
            return TRUE;
        }
        return FALSE;
```

All you need to successfully implement the recipes presented in this book will be a computer, 100MB of extra disk space, and a text or code editor (not a word processor!). The first chapter will cover how to set up a PHP 7 development environment. Having a web server is optional as PHP 7 includes a development web server. An Internet connection is not required, but it might be useful to download code (such as the set of PSR-7 interfaces), and review PHP 7.x documentation.
Note: Code bundle is present for all the chapters except for the Appendix.
